Before you pour out your comments ... HOLD YOUR HORSES LOVE it aint complete there is obviously some changes coming up ...

ex0dUs was designed to bruteforce sites through URLs .. oh wait you got no internet ?

i gotcha .. the "wifi_cracker.py" is designed to display the available wifi (including hotspots obviously .. duh) connections around you and tries every commonly used password in rockyou.txt file aka "passwords.txt file". If rare passwords are used to protect their wifi well son today is not your lucky day.

moving on ....

Got a file which happened to be gpg encrypted with a password and you just cannot remember the simple password your smooth brained self kept and youre not good enough to read all asian languages ? 

well well well .. would you look at that as expected " i got you !!" 

"file_cracker.py" is used to try all possible commonly used passwords to decrypt the file from .. you guessed it .. "passwords.txt"

Not that good of a project is it ?

well love .. fear not that is not it !!!

1. i''m trying to implement multi-threading to speed up the process because you're lazy and hate waiting (i get you trust me i have ADHD too)
2. i'm going to use hydra to crack passwords to make it a bit more interesting 

That's All Folks for now .. i'm using python becuase you're better 

and as always .. Love you Nadeem <3
